Description: storage performance development kit
 Provides a set of tools and libraries for writing high performance, scalable,
 user-mode storage applications. It achieves high performance by moving all of
 the necessary drivers into userspace and operating in a polled mode instead of
 relying on interrupts, which avoids kernel context switches and eliminates
 interrupt handling overhead.
 .
 This package is provides the spdk tools.
